## Objective 
Setup ec2-ssh to login to AWS ec2 machines

--- 
 
**Step 1:** 

Run the following command on your mac
 
  <code> sudo easy_install ec2-ssh</code>

To check if the installation was successful, just run 

<code>ec2-ssh --help</code>

**Step 2:**

In your bashrc file enter the following

<code>vi ~/.bash_profile</code>
{% highlight css %}
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ALKLWQPNMQZXKJSHQ
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=WMSelkj02KJSLjlsjOQUOE220asdfdd
export EC2_PEM=PATH/TO/EC2.PEM
{% endhighlight %}

This will  need to provide those credentials everytime you run the <code>ec2-ssh</code> command


**NOTE:** This will require restarting your computer so that those environment variables are available. If you do not wish to restart your computer, just copy paste those export commands in your terminal
