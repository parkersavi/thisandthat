**Objective**: To understand flume and at the end of tutorial we will write our first flume example. We will cat a log file and write it's output on the screen

**Prerequisites**: [Flume Setup](/blog/flume-setup/)

Some flume concepts

* **Event (your data)** -   Whatever flows through flume is called an event whichc is basically your data.
A unit of data flow having a byte payload and an optional set of string attributes

* **Agent** -  An agent is a (JVM) process that hosts the components through which events flow from an external source to the next destination.
 An agent consists of 3 things Source, Channel and Sink.
 
	* **Source (more like a producer inside the Agent)** - consumes events delivered to it by an external source like webserver

	* **Channel (buffer)** -  passive store that keeps the event until it’s consumed by a Flume sink.
    
    * **Sink (more like a consumer inside the Agent)** - removes the event from the channel. You can write your own sinks and do whatever you feel like with the event
 

Now let's understand using an example.

**What we will do**: We will send data to flume Source, which will pass through the Channel and we will simply log the data using Sink
Once you have flume installed on your machine (See (Flume Setup Tutorial](blog/flume_setup)), all you need to do for this tutorial is just write a configuration file

**Steps:**

1) Go to the conf directory of your flume installation.
      {% highlight css %}  cd apache-flume/conf/{% endhighlight %}
 

2) Write configuration file and put it in your conf directory
            
{% highlight css %}  
 # give a name to your source, channels, sinks. Also name of the agent I have chose here is agent
 agent.sources = r1
 agent.channels = k1
 agent.sinks = c1
 

 # CONFIGURE SOURCE. cat the log on your server.
agent.sources.r1.type = exec
agent.sources.r1.command = cat /mydir/somefile.txt
 

 # CONFIGURE CHANNEL. Flume has several channel types (memory, file etc). 
 # We choose memory channel and It will buffer upto 1000 events
agent.channels.k1.type = memory
agent.channels.k1.capacity = 1000
agent.channels.k1.transactionCapacity = 100
 

 # CONFIGURE SINK. The type is logger which will print the output the file contents to screen
agent.sinks.c1.type = logger
 

 # CONNECT source,channel and sink. 
agent.sources.r1.channels = k1
agent.sinks.c1.channel = k1

 {% endhighlight %}

Save the above configuration in a file. Let's call it flume_logging.conf and put it under conf directory
 

3)  Run the example. Make sure you are in your apache-flume directory

{% highlight css %}
cd apache-flume/
   
# and run using following command
 bin/flume-ng agent \
    --conf conf  \
    --conf-file conf/flume_logging.conf  \
    --name agent \
     -Dflume.root.logger=INFO,console
      {% endhighlight %}
      
      
 **The output:** When flume runs, it should print whatever is in the file you tried to cat.
